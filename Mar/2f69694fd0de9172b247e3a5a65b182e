PRETORIA, March 7 – The National Energy Regulator of South Africa (Nersa) has granted electricity provider Eskom, a 9.4% tariff increase for 2019/2020. An increase of 8.1% will be seen in 20/21 and 5,2% in 202/2022. The cash-strapped power utility initially requested a 15% rate hike over the next three years, citing financial problems, including debt of over R400 billion. Eskom’s tariff hike will add more pressure on consumers who have just been hit with a hefty petrol price increase and are also due to incur a 29 cents a litre hike in government fuel levies from April 3 as announced during Finance Minister Tito Mboweni’s budget speech last month.
