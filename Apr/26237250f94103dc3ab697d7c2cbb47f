JOHANNESBURG, April 2  – Western Cape Community Safety  Alan Winde has called on police to make swift arrests in the deaths of the four people gunned down at an unofficial taxi rank in Hout Bay in Cape Town. The shooting occurred on Monday. “It is completely unacceptable that taxi associations turn to violence when they have disputes. I condemn this incident in the strongest possible terms. Lives were lost, and the entire community of Hout Bay was brought to a standstill due to the violence that erupted in the area,” Winde said “The Provincial Commissioner Lt Gen Jula, must be lauded for swiftly ensuring a greater police presence in the area. I call on the officers investigating this matter to leave no stone unturned in their pursuit of these criminals. Our residents should feel safe during their commutes. The SAPS needs to send a strong message to taxi operators that violence will not be tolerated, by bringing the perpetrators to book.” Winde urged anyone who has any information pertaining to the perpetrators to immediately share it with the police. “I also commend the (Western Cape) Minister of Public Works and Transport, Donald Grant for suspending the operating licenses of the two associations that have been fingered in this violence. We need a complete clampdown of illegal operators throughout the Province,” Winde said. (ANA)
