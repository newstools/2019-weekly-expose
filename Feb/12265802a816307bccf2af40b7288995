PARLIAMENT, February 20  – If Treasury does agree to bail out the cash-strapped public broadcaster, the entity will be placed under curatorship, Finance Minister Tito Mboweni said on Wednesday. During a media briefing ahead of the tabling of the national budget in Parliament, Mboweni said the SABC was asking it for R6.8 billion. He indicated no money will be handed over without a chief reorginasation officer being appointed to oversee the operations of the SABC or other state-owned entities seeking government guarantees. “Should we agree to make available the R6.8 billion you can rest assured our chief reorganisation officer will be at Auckland park. There is no giving money without supervision. Those days are over.” (ANA)
