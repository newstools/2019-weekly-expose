Barcelona (dpa) – Cristiano Ronaldo accepted a huge fine and a suspended jail sentence for tax fraud striking a deal with Spanish prosecutors on Tuesday. The former Manchester United and Real Madrid star, 33, will pay a total of 18.8 million euros (21.3 million dollars) after pleading guilty at a hearing in Madrid. Ronaldo, who now plays for Juventus, also received a 23-month prison sentence but as a first-time offender for a non-violent crime it is suspended and he will not go to prison. The investigation into Ronaldo was opened in 2017 when he was still a Real Madrid player. He was accused of having used companies in tax havens to avoid paying tax on image rights between 2011 and 2014.
