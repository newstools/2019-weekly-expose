JOHANNESBURG, January 21 – The African National Congress on Monday said it has “learnt with sadness” of the passing of Ambassador Dumisani Khumalo, who served South Africa diligently as the country’s diplomat to the United Nations. “The African National Congress dips its revolutionary flag and extends its condolences to the family, friends as well as to his fellow comrades in the struggle for liberation of the oppressed,” said the ruling party in a statement issued by the acting national spokesperson, Zizi Kodwa. Narrating the struggle activist’s life, Kodwa said Khumalo was forced into exile because of his anti-apartheid activities. While on asylum in the United States, he continued his political activities as a project director at the American Committee on Africa (ACOA) and its sister organisation, the Africa Fund from 1979 to 1997. Khumalo played a key role in the mobilisation of American sanctions against the racist Apartheid regime. Khumalo’s actions culminated in the racist regime being hauled to the UN Security Council in the 80s. He distinguished himself as a diplomat par excellence when the consolidation of the African Agenda found expression in the multilateral sphere which entailed a report on how the UN could assist our continent in the resolution of conflicts. Khumalo was first deployed to the United Nations in 1999 and returned home a decade later following the country’s successful tenure as a non-permanent member of the Security Council ended in 2009. The 71-year-old ambassador passed away peacefully at his home on Sunday. (ANA)
