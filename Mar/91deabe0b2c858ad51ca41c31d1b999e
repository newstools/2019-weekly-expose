BLOEMFONTEIN, March 30  – A 45-year-old man convicted of raping his daughters has been sentenced to two life imprisonment terms in the Botshabelo Regional Court near Bloemfontein for raping his own two daughters, Free State police said on Saturday. “On 26 November 2017 the accused’s family, consisting of two daughters and a son, were about to sleep in section F, Botshabelo,” Sergeant Martin Xuma said in a statement. “The father called a 14-year-old daughter to his bedroom and asked her to massage him. He undressed his daughter and raped her.” The victim reported the matter to a church member who alerted the police. A rape case was opened and assigned to Detective Constable George Dlamini of the Selosesha family violence, child protection, and sexual offences unit. The accused was apprehended within two days and during the investigation it emerged that he had also raped his 16-year-old daughter. While he was in custody the children were taken in by a church member as their mother had already died, Xuma said. (ANA)
