JOHANNESBURG, February 18 – An investigation into Gauteng’s two mayoral councils that illegally invested public funds at the now-defunct VBS Mutual Bank is almost completed, said Gauteng Premier David Makhura. He said investigators will hand over the report to him next week. “I keenly await the outcome of the forensic investigation into VBS instituted by the provincial Treasury so that appropriate action can be taken against those responsible,” said Makhura as he delivered his state of the province address in Alberton. Gauteng Treasury said last year that its investigation would look into whether the VBS investments breached the Municipal Finance Management Act and whether any official should be charged with misconduct as a result. The West Rand district municipality had R81 million invested with VBS while Merafong invested R50 million. (ANA)
