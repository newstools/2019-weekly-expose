SFAX, Tunisia, March 22  – France-based Bafana Bafana winger Keagan Dolly has been ruled out of his side’s Caf Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Libya, in Sfax, Tunisia, on Sunday due to stiffness in his hamstrings. Dolly has been missing for his club because of injury and recently made a comeback, albeit playing in the reserves – and Bafana Bafana coach Stuart Baxter had hoped that he would be fit for the crucial weekend clash, but it was not to be. “Keagan had been doing very well in training but has had to be ruled out of this encounter due to stiffness in his right hamstring,” said Baxter. “We are fully aware that both him and Bongani Zungu came into the camp after being declared medically fit to play, but with the different weather conditions we have had, and training on different pitches throughout the week, this has caused some strain on Keagan. The good news, however, is that Bongani is looking very good in training and has really pushed himself. “We also had a little scare with Kamo (Kamogelo Mokotjo) a few days ago, when he had a swollen Achilles but he is now fine and raring to go. Rivaldo Coetzee, who also came into the camp with a little strain from his weekend match, has done very well and there are no worries about him.” A draw for South Africa will see them clinch a spot at this year’s Afcon tournament, which will played in Egypt in June.
