JOHANNESBURG, March 12  – A three-year-old boy was rescued from a vehicle which was hijacked in the early hours of Tuesday morning at Wilersfarm near Lenasia and was later found abandoned at Thulamtwana informal settlement, Gauteng police said. Police spokesperson Colonel Lungelo Dlamini said two women have been taken into custody for questioning following the incident. Dlamini said the child was found in the car and attended to by the paramedics and found to be in good health. “It is alleged that the victim, a man aged 37, was driving with his girlfriend when he stopped at the side of the road. Two men who came from the nearby bush pointed him with firearms and took the vehicle. The vehicle was tracked and found at an informal settlement not far from where it had been hijacked.” “The victim and his girlfriend were not injured during a hijacking,” said Dlamini. He said the suspects were being questioned as they may have conspired with the hijackers. Once they have been charged, they will be taken to the Vereeniging Magistrate’s Court where they may be charged as accomplices to the hijacking. The two male suspects who hijacked the victim were still at large and police were following several leads to arrest them. (ANA)
