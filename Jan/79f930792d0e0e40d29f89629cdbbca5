JOHANNESBURG, January 14 – The hearings of the judicial commission of inquiry into allegations of state capture headed by Deputy Chief Justice Raymond Zondo will resume on Tuesday after a month-long hiatus, but will not hear any oral evidence. The inquiry, which is investigating allegations of corruption and fraud in the public sector including organs of state, will deal with a procedural application on some of the upcoming evidence. For the rest of the week, the commission will hear oral evidence but the witness list has not yet been released. In December, some of the witnesses who meant to testify became unavailable while others asked for a postponement. The so-called Zondo Commission has heard explosive testimonies from various witnesses, including former mineral resources minster Ngoako Ramatlhodi, head of government communications Phumla Williams and government spindoctor-turned-politician Mzwanele Manyi, among many others.
