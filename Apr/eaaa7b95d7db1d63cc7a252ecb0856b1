JOHANNESBURG, April 11  – Government sources have confirmed that Sudanese President Omar Al Bashir has stepped down. A military council is to take his place with a major announcement expected shortly by the military which has taken over the national TV and radio station as protesters take to the streets yet again. Mumtaz News and Al Arabiya reported on Thursday morning that in addition to the above developments, Khartoum Airport has been closed and a number of top leaders arrested as Army chiefs hold a meeting as reports of a coup circulate. These breaking developments come after the spokesperson for the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF), Ahmed Khalifa Al Shami, retracted a Wednesday statement in which he said a decision to forcibly disperse a major sit-in by protesters outside army headquarters had been cancelled. Bashir had ordered his security forces to break up the mass protest which began over the weekend. However, military leaders argued against the move stating that it would lead to large losses of life. Furthermore, in a growing sign of military disapproval, junior officers clashed with security forces as they tried to protect protesters leading to a number of deaths, including members of the forces.
