JOHANNESBURG, March 27 – The South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) on Wednesday found that Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema’s controversial comments on race do not constitute hate speech. The SAHRC chair Bongani Majola said the commission has received five complaints against Malema and his EFF party since 2016. Although it has found no wrong-doing on the part of Malema, the SAHRC said it remained concerned about his utterances. The complaints before the commission included Malema calling for the “slaughter” of white people. It concluded that while this could be construed as hurtful, it should be seen in context, and Malema said that white people would not be killed under his leadership. The commission also found that a tweet by EFF member of Parliament (MP) Godrich Gardee referring to Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane as “Garden Boy” was insulting and offensive but did not constitute hate speech. The slur was made in the context of race and historical background, the Commission said. (ANA)
