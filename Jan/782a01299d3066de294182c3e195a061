JOHANNESBURG, January 15  – Prosecutors at the International Criminal Court (ICC) at the Hague have been dealt a blow with the dismissal of charges of crimes against humanity levelled against former Ivory Coast president Laurent Gbagbo. On Tuesday, presiding judge Cuno Tarfusser asserted that the prosecutors had failed to prove their case against 73-year-old Gbagbo and his co-defendant, Charles Ble Goude, a former political youth leader, and ally of the former president. Tarfusser said a majority of the three-judge chamber had ruled that “the prosecutor has failed to satisfy the burden of proof” again the two men. He then ordered the pair be freed, the Guardian reported. Gbagbo was brought to stand trial at the Hague in November 2011 following the death of approximately 3,000 people in a campaign of violence allegedly orchestrated by him following his 2010 electoral defeat by Alassane Outtara. The former leader had refused to hand over power in the wake of Outtara’s victory but was eventually cornered in a basement by French soldiers as the UN attempted to end the conflict. In 2016, the former university professor-turned-political activist denied four counts of crimes against humanity, including ordering murder and gang rape. (ANA)
