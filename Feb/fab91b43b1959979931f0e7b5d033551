JOHANNESBURG, February 27  – President Cyril Ramaphosa has congratulated his Nigerian counterpart, Muhammadu Buhari, following his successful re-election to the position of President of the Republic of Nigeria as declared by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), according to a Wednesday press release by the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco). The African Union Election Observation Mission (AUEOM) to Nigeria released a statement on February 23 stating that overall the Nigerian electoral process was peaceful and orderly and conformed with Abuja’s legal framework. Ramaphosa said Nigerians should be commended for both their patience, after the elections were initially postponed, and for the peaceful manner in which they conducted themselves during voting. South Africa and Nigeria enjoy good political, economic and social relations formally established in 1994, immediately after South Africa’s first democratic elections. The two countries have thus far signed 34 bilateral agreements covering various areas such as arts and culture, education, agriculture, trade and investment, mining, defence, policing, immigration, taxation, science and technology, health, tourism, environment and energy. During a visit to Nigeria in July the South African president held bilateral talks with Buhari as the two governments recommitted to deepening cooperation at the bilateral, continental and multilateral levels.
