PRETORIA, March 19 – The Tshwane Metro Police Department (TMPD) arrested a group of touts who invaded the Winternest licencing offices, north of Pretoria, tearing down posters warning members of the public against corruption, spokesperson Isaac Mahamba said on Tuesday. “The runners went inside, destroying property and removing posters that were pasted to alert the public to refrain from seeking assistance from strangers outside the licensing centre,” said the TMPD senior superintendent. “TMPD officers quickly responded to the call and managed to arrest four suspects who were found removing the posters. The four suspects were arrested for damage to property and will soon appear in court.” Mahamba appealed to members of the public to stop requesting any assistance from the “runners” outside licencing centres and to only seek assistance at the counters inside the centres to prevent being conned. “As the TMPD, we will continue to monitor the situation at the licencing centre to maintain the safety of the people and the workers who were traumatised by the incident. The Winternest licencing centre is currently closed until further notice,” he said. “Workers that were affected will receive proper assistance to recover from the shock and any trauma that they may have incurred.” (ANA)
