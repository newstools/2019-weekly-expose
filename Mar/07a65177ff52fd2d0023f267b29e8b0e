DURBAN, March 5 – The secretary of the African National Congress in KwaZulu-Natal, Mdumiseni Ntuli, has said that the party may just record the best election results it has had since taking over governance of the province. “There is going to be a decisive victory for the ANC [nationally], anything from 65% or going up. [As for KwaZulu-Natal], we are very optimistic about it. We are likely to get results far better than we have ever done since ANC took over the province,” said Ntuli. He was speaking to journalists, editors and academics during a question and answer session following a media briefing – hosted by the party – at the Coastlands Musgrave hotel in Durban on Tuesday. South Africans go to the polls on May 8 in what has been billed the country’s most important national election since the advent of democracy 25 years ago. ANC KZN chairman Sihle Zikalala, who was also present at the event, offered his forecasts. Zikalala – currently the provincial MEC for economic development and tourism – is likely to be installed as premier following the election. “Post May 8, the KwaZulu-Natal legislature will have four parties. The ANC will lead and the opposition will share less than 35%,” he said. “The DA will be at the same level or slightly reduced [in numbers from the last national election]; the IFP will be at the same level or just gaining from the NFP,” he said. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) would “grab a portion of the young in tertiary education. They exploit grievances,” said Zikalala of the red berets. The remaining smaller parties would win one seat, he said, and the DA would benefit from the Minority Front, he said. “The ANC will retain its support and possibly increase [its voter share amongst] Indians, coloureds and whites. That is the general assessment from the ANC side,” said Zikalala. (ANA)
