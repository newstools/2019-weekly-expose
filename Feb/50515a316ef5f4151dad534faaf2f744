Solly Makganoto JOHANNESBURG- Controversial civic organisation Concerned members Of ANC lead by Bishop Hangwi Maumela on Monday described Zizi Kodwa’s rape accusations as an attempt to derail the ANC from focusing on the elections for a ‘decisive victory’ in the elections in May 2019. Maumela said the accusations should be rejected with the contempt they deserve “especially when the accuser herself takes a toxic posture by asking women not to vote for the ANC”. He further said that the accuser is not seeking justice, but to harm the ANC. “We know comrade Zizi as a disciplined member of the ANC, performing his work with diligence and he knows the dos and don’ts, he also knows that women’s emancipation is not an act of charity, the liberation of women is a fundamental necessity and a pre condition for the final victory of the National Democratic Revolution,we also are alive to the fact that the women of our country will be able to distinguish what is reported as an abuse in order to achieve factional agenda and the real abuses meeted out against women, because failure to do so has the capacity to undermine the very struggles and achievements regarding women’s emancipation,according to the letter written by Zizi Kodwas accuser,it took 10 months for the letter to be revealed, which letter raises serious allegations of rape against one of the seasoned cadres of our movement, the ANC, said Maumela in a statement. Mahumela said that it is very difficult to accept and believe the accusations merely because the accuser does not even have a case number, which means that she has not reported the matter to the police. “However if the accuser is of the view that she has a case, we agree and support the statement of the African National Congress that the matter be brought to the attention of law enforcement agencies. “We urge the NEC of which cde Zizi is a member to focus on this important task of a decisive victory in the elections. As head in the presidency Cde is aware of the challenges and we are confident that he will rise to the occasion as loyal and disciplined member of the ANC”.
