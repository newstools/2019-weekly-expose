CAPE TOWN, January 11 – Former Miss Universe, South African Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters, has become engaged to her American sports star boyfriend Tim Tebow, a statement said. It said Tebow proposed to Nel-Peters at his family farm in Jacksonville, Florida on January 9 after the pair had dated since last April. The former NFL quarterback and current Major League Baseball outfielder for the New York Mets secretly flew Nel-Peters’ family and some of her closest friends to the United States for the occasion. He also flew in South African artist Matthew Mole to play Nel-Peters’ favourite song as he popped the question. Flashing her flawless 7.25-carat diamond engagement ring, Nel-Peters said she was ecstatic and hadn’t stopped smiling since Tebow proposed. “Any dreams I’ve ever had, Tim you’ve exceeded them all! I love you and I can’t wait to spend forever with you,” she said. Tebow said during an interview with the American Today show last year that meeting Nel-Peters was a result of “seizing the moment”. He also told sports television channel ESPN that she was “a really special woman and I am very lucky and blessed to have her coming into my life”. The pair spent Christmas in South Africa with Nel-Peters set to return for a visit in February. – African News Agency (ANA)
