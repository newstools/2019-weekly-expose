CAPE TOWN, February 11 – President Cyril Ramaphosa on Monday congratulated the Soweto Gospel Choir after it won its third Grammy award at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards ceremony held at Staples Center in Los Angeles on Sunday. On his Twitter account, the South African president said: “Congratulations to the Soweto Gospel Choir for being awarded the Best World Music album for ‘Freedom’ at the #GRAMMYs. This is the choir’s third Grammy award and we thank them for telling our story to the world and flying the flag high.” The Parliamentary portfolio committee on Arts and Culture also congratulated the group. Committee chairperson Xoliswa Tom said: “As South Africans, we are extremely proud of the choir, whose music not only inspires but also illuminates the hearts and minds of people around the world.” The choir won Grammys in 2007 and 2008, in the Best Traditional World Music Album category both times. This year’s award-winning album, Freedom, was the choir’s tribute to South African icon Nelson Mandela, in commemoration of his 100th birthday. “The portfolio committee extends its heartfelt congratulations to the Soweto Gospel Choir, which received this prestigious award at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards ceremony held at Staples Center in Los Angeles on Sunday,” said Tom.
