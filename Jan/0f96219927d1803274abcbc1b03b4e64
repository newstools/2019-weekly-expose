JOHANNESBURG, January 23  – Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) leader Julius Malema on Wednesday gave South African President Cyril Ramaphosa until month end to prove his dealings with Bosasa was above board or face a roasting in Parliament during the state-of-the-nation address next month. Addressing a media briefing on his party’s preparations of this years coming elections, Malema said Ramaphosa’s explanation on a R500,000 donation to his campaign to become president of the ruling party was not sufficient. “Ramaphosa, as the president of the republic, must call an open press conference and take the country into his confidence about his dealings with Bosasa,” said Malema. “His explanation in Parliament about Bosasa has exposed him as having lied since both his son and Bosasa have contradicted him.” During a presidential question-and-answer session in the National Assembly In November last year, Ramaphosa was asked about a R500,000 payment from Bosasa, which now trades under the name African Global Operations, to his son. Ramaphosa said the money was paid for advisory services provided from his son Andile’s company to Bosasa. After Andile refuted this, Ramaphosa backtracked, writing to Parliament saying he had inadvertently provided members of Parliament (MPs) with the wrong information, saying the money was in fact paid to fund his campaign for African National Congress (ANC) president. Former Bosasa chief operating officer Angelo Agrizzi’s testimony in the state capture commission of inquiry over the past week has revealed how several ministers and state officials were allegedly bribed to give the company preferential treatment when multi-billion rand government contracts were being awarded.
