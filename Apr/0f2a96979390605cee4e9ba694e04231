JOHANNESBURG April 1 – SA premiership side Free State Stars on Monday confirmed the death of their midfielder Sinethemba Jantjie.
Jantjie, 30, was killed in a car accident in the early hours of Monday morning.
“It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Free State Stars midfielder Sinethemba Jantjie,” said the club in a statement.
“Mr. Jantjie passed away in the early hours of the morning when his car was involved in an accident.
“The club plans to meet with Jantjie’s family, after which they will give further details of the funeral and memorial arrangements.
“Jantjie was a late bloomer in the PSL [Premier Soccer League], making his debut in his late 20s in 2016/17. He was a regular starter for Stars and his good form caught the eye of Gavin Hunt at Bidvest Wits who had signed him on a pre-contract for next season.” (ANA)
