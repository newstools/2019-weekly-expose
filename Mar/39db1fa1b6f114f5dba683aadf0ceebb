JOHANNESBURG, March 15 – The South Gauteng High Court on Thursday granted former Johannesburg mayor, Parks Tau, leave to appeal its ruling on the defamation case filed by the present mayor Herman Mashaba. Judge Van der Linde granted Tau leave to appeal at the Supreme Court of Appeal on the grounds that “there is reasonable prospect that another court could come to a different conclusion on the question of defamation”. The judge said Tau “has reasonable prospect of success on appeal”, and that it was also in the interest of justice that leave to appeal be granted. The ruling effectively suspends Judge Van der Linde’s earlier judgment of the 8 February 2019 in which he found Tau at fault. The former mayor had been interdicted from making further remarks that suggest Mashaba was sexist and anti-black. Tau made the remarks at a Johannesburg Councillor’s funeral shortly soon after Mashaba took office in August 2016. This was after Mashaba reportedly said: “The days when they [ANC government in Johannesburg] allowed their girlfriends to run state institutions are over”. (ANA)
