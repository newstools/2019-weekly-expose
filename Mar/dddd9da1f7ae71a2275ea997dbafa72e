DURBAN, March 1 – The risk of loadshedding for Friday and the weekend is high, according to Eskom. The power producer made the announcement via an emailed statement late on Thursday night. “No loadshedding was implemented today (Thursday) due to some generating units returning to service, however the risk of loadshedding for [Friday] and the weekend remains high. “As the power system remains tight and volatile, the risk of rotational loadshedding remains high for [Friday] as well as for the weekend when we need to replenish emergency reserves (water and diesel) to limit the possibility of loadshedding in the following week. “Our maintenance teams continue to work around the clock to bring units back online.” (ANA)
