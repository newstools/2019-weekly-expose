DURBAN, April 10  – The African National Congress late on Tuesday night said it distanced itself from a disruption of the book launch for Gangster State: Unravelling Ace Magashule’s Web of Capture, written by Pieter-Louis Myburgh. “The ANC distances itself from the disruption of the launch of the book, Gangster State, on Tuesday evening in Sandton,” said the governing party via an emailed statement. In footage displayed on social media and television, supporters of ANC secretary-general Ace Magashule could be seen storming Exclusive Books at Sandton City and ripping apart copies of the book. They also tried to intimidate those at the launch by shouting at them to ‘Go’. “The ANC condemns the disruption and the call to burn books in the strongest possible terms. We wish to emphasise that those who disrupted the launch did not do so in the name of the ANC nor on behalf of the ANC Secretary General. We view the actions of these individuals in a very serious light as it undermines freedom of speech,” said the statement. “Our constitutional democracy enjoins us to defend every citizen’s right to freedom of speech irrespective of whether we agree with the contents or not. The ANC appeals to all its structures to observe and adhere to the letter and spirit of our constitution,” said the statement. The book deals with allegations of bribery and corruption involving Magashule during his tenure as Free State premier and his connections to the infamous Gupta family. (ANA)
