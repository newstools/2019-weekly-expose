PRETORIA, March 5 – Nicholas Ninow, the man accused of raping a seven-year-old girl in a Dros restaurant, wept on Tuesday as the Pretoria Magistrate’s Court moved his case to the high court for trial. The trial will take place in the superior court from September 9 until the 20th. Rape accused Ninow kept his face hidden, as activists in the public gallery kept shouting at him to look up. In January, Ninow was referred for a 30-day mental evaluation mental evaluation at Weskoppies psychiatric hospital in Pretoria. He faces charges of rape, possession of drugs, assault with intent to do bodily harm and intimidation. The accused allegedly followed the little girl from the Dros restaurant’s play area to the toilets where he raped the child. The girl’s mother caught him in the act after she went looking for her. The court had previously heard that Ninow has mental issues, and has previously attempted suicide several times due to depression caused by bipolar disorder. Police said the white powder they found on the accused was the drug Tik – medically known as methamphetamine — a potent central nervous system stimulant that is mainly used as a recreational drug.
