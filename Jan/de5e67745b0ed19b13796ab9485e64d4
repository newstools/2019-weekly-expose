MAHIKENG, January 28 – Two men convicted of killing Matlhomola Mosweu in Coligny after he stole sunflower seeds should be sentenced to a life imprisonment,  the North West High Court heard on Monday. “The parents of the accused could visit them in prison, they can talk to them and hug them, but for the Mosweu’s family they will never talk to their son. If it was in the past they [the accused] deserved hang paal [death sentence] but now a life sentence will be an appropriate sentence,”  community leader Stan Mnyakama told the court. Mnyakama was testifying in aggravation of sentence against Pieter Doorewaard, 27, and Phillip Schutte, 34, convicted of killing Mosweu, 16. He said the community was deeply hurt by the death of Mosweu. “The community was hurt. This incident was reported to me on Sunday, that a boy was killed on Thursday, and there has not been any arrest. I immediately called detective Seponkane to attend to the case.” Mynakama, who is a school principal, told the court irate community members even went to schools, taking learners out of class. He said he went to town and saw farmers driving into town with bakkies, stopping at street corners. “I was afraid that if one person could be shot by one of the farmers, the town would be destroyed.” He said prior to the death of Mosweu, blacks and whites were tolerating each other but now they were drifting apart. Doorewaard and Schutte appear to have lost some weight since they were convicted in October and have been kept in custody since. (ANA)
