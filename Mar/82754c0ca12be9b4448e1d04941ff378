JOHANNESBURG, March 16 – Power blackouts, or “load shedding”, moved to stage four from 12 noon on Saturday “due to the loss of additional capacity from Mozambique”, embattled state-owned power supplier Eskom said. “While the power system remains tight and vulnerable, we remind customers that load shedding is a controlled process to protect the power grid from a total collapse or blackout. Having lost capacity from Mozambique earlier today [Saturday], Eskom lost an additional 900MW at about 10.30am due to a line fault, requiring a shift from stage three to stage four. Stage four calls for 4000MW to be rotationally load shed nationally at a given period,” Eskom said in a statement. “We continue to appeal to residents and businesses to use electricity sparingly during this period. Please switch off geysers as well as all non-essential lighting and electricity appliances to assist in reducing demand,” the parastatal said. For Eskom customers, these schedules are available on the Eskom website (http://loadshedding.eskom.co.za). Eskom customers can also contact the customer contact centre at 0860 037 566. (ANA)
