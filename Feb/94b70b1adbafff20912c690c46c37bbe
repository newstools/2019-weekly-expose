JOHANNESBURG, February 1  – Three children were killed and approximately 15 others injured on Friday morning when a walkway at a high school in Vanderbijlpark in southern Gauteng collapsed. ER24 spokesperson Russel Meiring said when paramedics arrived on the scene they found that the structure, which connected two buildings, had collapsed and trapped several people. “The trapped patients were freed. Three children, aged between 14 and 17, had sustained numerous fatal injuries. Nothing could be done for them and they were declared dead,” said Meiring. He said about 15 other patients were assessed, their injuries ranging from minor to critical. They were treated for their injuries. Some required advanced life support interventions. “Once treated, four children were airlifted to hospital by a private medical helicopter. The remaining patients were transported by ambulance to various facilities in the area,” said Meiring. Local authorities were on the scene for further investigations. The Gauteng department of education said it had conveyed its condolences to the families of the children and MEC Panyaza Lesufi was visiting the school to offer his support and try to help establish the cause of the accident. (ANA)
