JOHANNESBURG, April 2 – South African blind cricketer Jackson Make on Tuesday graduated with his Bachelor of Social Science degree from the University of KwaZulu-Natal (UKZN), describing this as one of his greatest achievements. “I am totally blind but I’m good at fielding and bowling. I rely on the sound of the ball,” said Make, who also plans to pursue postgraduate studies in the future and to continue excelling in cricket. He was part of the South African squad that participated in the 40 over Blind Cricket World Cup held in Cape Town in 2014 and also participated in the T20 Blind Cricket World Cup that took place in India in 2012. Make was nominated by the KZN Cricket Union as the Blind Cricketer of the Year in 2014. Blind cricket is played with a plastic ball with bearings inside that make a sound when it moves. The stumps are metal and make a clanging sound when hit. Make, who attended a school for the blind in the Free State, hopes to be an inspiration to other blind and partially-sighted students through his exploits on the cricket field as well as his academic pursuits.  (ANA)
