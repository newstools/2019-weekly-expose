JOHANNESBURG, March 13  – Two days after taxi drivers blockaded the Johannesburg CBD with taxis, Gauteng MEC for Roads and Transport Ismail Vadi on Wednesday announced the closure of routes operated by warring Soweto taxi associations. Nancefield Dube West Taxi Association (Nanduwe) and Witwatersrand Taxi Association (Wata) routes will be closed with effect from Friday and will be in place for three months. This comes after three people were shot dead and as many as six wounded during recent taxi violence. On Monday, hundreds of minibus taxis blocked streets in the CBD in protest at threats that their routes may be closed if the violence in the industry continues. They were demanding an audience with Vadi and said that during the closure period there must be discussions and consultations with relevant structures of associations to find a resolution. Vadi, however, said that such lawlessness in the taxi industry was intolerable and he called on taxi owners not to allow their drivers to engage in illegal actions. (ANA)
