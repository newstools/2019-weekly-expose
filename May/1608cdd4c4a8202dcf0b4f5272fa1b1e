Solly Makganoto Bafana Bafana and Union Saint-Gilloise forward Percy Tau was on Monday named the Belgian Division 1  season 2018/19 Proximus League Player of the Year. Tau was loaned out to Union Saint-Gilloise in the Belgian second tier by English Premiership Leauge side Brighton & Hove Albion last season. The loan spell ended Tau’s chances to play in top-flight football and arguably in one of the world’s best leagues. The Bafana Bafana striker argued that being loaned to a lower division side was all not doom and gloom and that he saw the brighter side of things . He said he was enjoying life in Belgium. “People will always have opinions on things and they are entitled to that. I am happy with this path I have chosen (agreeing to go on loan to Royale Union Saint-Gilloise) because I have done it before and things worked out in my favour. “I once went out on loan to Witbank Spurs and things worked out pretty well for me later on,” he asserted adding the recent move was a strategic and wise one. The diminutive striker began his career with South African Premiership side Mamelodi Sundowns. He spent a season with Witbank Spurs in 2015/16, before returning to Sundowns in 2016.
