MANCHESTER, England — Manchester United has made coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer a permanent hire, and given him a three-year contract. The former United striker, who was installed as caretaker boss in December after the sacking of Jose Mourinho, signed a three-year contract. In a statement to the New York Stock Exchange, United said the Norwegian, whose goal won the Champions League in 1999, was “the right man to take the club forward”. “Since coming in as caretaker manager in December, the results Ole has delivered speak for themselves,” Ed Woodward, United’s executive vice-chairman, said. “More than just performances and results, Ole brings a wealth of experience, both as a player and as a coach, coupled with a desire to give young players their chance and a deep understanding of the culture of the club. “This all means that he is the right person to take Manchester United forward.” Under Solsjkaer, United have won 14 and drawn two of their 19 games, putting them back in the chase for a top-four spot in the Premier League and taking them into the quarter-finals of the Champions League. They are currently fifth in the table, two points behind Arsenal in fourth and only three adrift of third-placed Tottenham Hotspur. “From the first day I arrived, I felt at home at this special club,” Solskjaer said. “It was an honour to be a Manchester United player, and then to start my coaching career here. The last few months have been a fantastic experience and I want to thank all of the coaches, players and staff for the work we’ve done so far. “This is the job that I always dreamed of doing and I’m beyond excited to have the chance to lead the club long-term and hopefully deliver the continued success that our amazing fans deserve.” Solskjaer, 46, struggled badly with Cardiff City in a previous spell managing in the Premier League but achieved success with Molde, another of his former clubs, in Norway. (AP)
