THOHOYANDOU, February 14 – A torrential downpour at the Thohoyandou Stadium on Wednesday night forced the Nedbank Cup last-16 tie between Black Leopards and Bidvest Wits to be abandoned. After what had been a disjointed first half – both teams had made seven changes to their starting XI’s – the home side scored through a well-taken strike from just outside the area from Lesedi Kapinga on 36 minutes. However, with the rain bucketing down incessantly from around the 20 minute mark, the teams never came out for the second half as the pitch had become completely waterlogged. Premier Soccer League Chief Operations Officer Professor Ronnie Schloss confirmed afterwards that the entire match will be replayed. “The referee and the officials assessed the pitch and found it to be dangerous to the players,” he said. “The league will make an announcement on Thursday (as to when the game will be played). The match will be from scratch – a new match, and any goal will be expunged.” (ANA)
