Since the video went viral, local celebrities have expressed their outrage and support. During our gangster days we used to abuse ladies, they would fear leaving us, they would fear for their lives and the lives of family. Babes Wodumo needs protection. Mapinsta should go to jail, friend or no friend, he is a piece of shit. Babes is crying out for help. — Gayton McKenzie (@G_XCON) March 4, 2019  Mampintsha needs to be stopped. I hope they make an example out of him so every man knows that hitting a woman is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. My heart breaks for Babes. — #MeetingYourPower #ERAbyDJZinhle #ZeeNation (@DJZinhle) March 4, 2019  Actually… Fuck Mampintsha! — #Azania  (@ReasonHD) March 4, 2019  First off, fuck Mampintsha! I said it then & I’ll say it now. He needs to be arrested & I hope it happens today. For those that keep asking though, this doesn’t change a damn thing about how Masechaba handled that situation. That sh!t was wrong too. — Sizwe Dhlomo (@SizweDhlomo) March 4, 2019  F*ck Mampintsha! Surely there’s NO defending him and his abusive ways.
If he is not made an example of, the system will be blatantly failing victims of abuse. I just hope Babes uses the same courage she had to take the video, to press charges against him this time around. — Maps Maponyane (@MapsMaponyane) March 4, 2019  As artists we have to take a stand against men like Mampintsha. We cannot allow these abusive & monstrous acts to continue under our watch. We have to protect Babes & other women from abusers like him. Mampintsha must be arrested, FULL STOP! — Prince Kaybee (@PrinceKaybee_SA) March 4, 2019  Saw that Mampintsha vid earlier. Bo satane fela. Wtf. You can feel the pure evil in that man. Can’t imagine how fearful Babes must be in his presence. We all know how grooming works and psychopaths operate, don’t come here with “she should have left, it’s her fault” crap. — Lesego Semenya (@LesDaChef) March 4, 2019
