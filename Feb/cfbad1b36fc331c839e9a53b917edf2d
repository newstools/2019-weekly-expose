CAPE TOWN, February 10 – Sekunjalo Investment Holdings has taken issue with the Sunday Times newspaper over a defamatory article about the company published on Sunday. “Today [Sunday], the Sunday Times, which is part of the Tiso Blackstar Group and a direct competitor of Independent Media, published a highly defamatory article about the Sekunjalo Group investee company AYO Technology Solutions (AYO),” Sekunjalo said in a statement. Tiso Blackstar online and print publications had over the past five years, and especially the past few months, published countless defamatory articles about Sekunjalo Group companies, the statement said. “In almost all instances these articles were defamatory, without substance, and taken out of context with the sole intent of damaging Dr Iqbal Survé and that of the Sekunjalo Group and the investee companies African Equity Empowerment Investments Limited (AEEI) and AYO. “Sunday Times has recently been accused of having agendas about ‘fake news’, for example Cato Manor and the SARS [South African Revenue Service] rogue unit, which forced its editor to apologise for untruthful reporting. “The Sunday Times did not give the Sekunjalo investee companies AYO and AEEI boards or management teams reasonable time to respond as is required by the Press Code. This is in violation of the Press Code and our constitutional right to fairness and accuracy in reporting. “The Sunday Times instead went ahead and published a one-sided sensationalist article similar to what it did the week before,” the statement said. The Sekunjalo Group of companies would respond by issuing a comprehensive media statement “dealing with each lie stated in the article by latest Monday the 11th February”. Once all the Sekunjalo Group investee companies’ boards mentioned in the Sunday Times article had met to discuss the matter, “we will call a national media conference to deal with these blatant lies and misrepresentations”, the statement said.
