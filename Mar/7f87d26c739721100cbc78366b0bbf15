CAPE TOWN, March 7 – The City of Cape Town on Thursday announced that Cape Town has been chosen as the preferred host city for the 2023 Netball World Cup after a successful bid to host the tournament. The South African team, which consists of the City of Cape Town, Netball South Africa, as well as national and provincial government, was notified on Thursday by the International Netball Federation that its delegation offered a successful bid for the prestigious tournament. The delegation submitted its proposal for staging the netball showpiece in Singapore in November. The City’s mayoral committee member for safety and security, JP Smith said: “It is the first time that the largest women’s sporting event in the world will be hosted on African soil and Cape Town will work hard to make the 2023 Netball World Cup the best one yet. “A lot of hard work and intense preparations from all spheres of government went into the bid to present what Cape Town has to offer. It was a team effort which showcased our world-class facilities, infrastructure, as well as expertise in hosting major international events.” Smith said having developed a strong track record as the world’s leading festival and event destination, Cape Town is best placed to make the Netball World Cup a spectacular showpiece, the same way the city successfully hosted the FIFA World Cup in 2010. “Being chosen as the host city for this global spectacle underscores the city’s status as an events capital. Apart from the direct economic impact through visitor and organiser spend, there is also the ripple effect of job creation during and after events, and the increased spend at our world-famous attractions,” added Smith.
