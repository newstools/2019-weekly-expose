PORT ELIZABETH, January 9 – The revolving door that is the Chippa United managerial hot-seat has spat out its latest victim, with caretaker head coach Joel Masutha reportedly set to be replaced by Clinton Larsen. Former Black Leopards coach Masutha only arrived at Chippa at the start of last month and has been in charge for five matches, the first two of which ended in draws, while the last three games were all defeats. The latest setback came on Tuesday night, when the Chilli Boys put up a spirited performance against Orlando Pirates in Soweto, but went down 4-2, leaving them in the relegation zone. While Chippa United boss Chippa Mpengesi is notoriously trigger-happy when it comes to giving his coaches the axe, the club’s new CEO Morgan Mammila (who only joined last week from Baroka FC), has admitted he was behind Masutha’s dismissal. The club are expected to announce shortly that it will be Larsen – who made way for Steve Komphela at Golden Arrows two days after Christmas, who will take on what must be South African football’s most unstable job. Former Bafana Bafana player Larsen will become the fourth man in charge of Chippa this season, following Masutha, Eric Tinkler, and Dan Malesela. Going back six years to January 2013, when William Mugeyi was given the job, the Eastern Cape side have since had 15 different coaches: Mark Harrison, Ian Palmer, Vladislav Heric, Kosta Papic, Roger Sikhakhane, Ernst Middendorp, Mich d’Avray, Velile Dyaloyi, Dan Malesela, Teboho Moloi, Heric, Malesela, Tinkler, Masutha and now Larsen.
