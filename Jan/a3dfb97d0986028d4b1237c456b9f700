JOHANNESBURG, January 15 – Murder accused Thulani Ngcobo better known as “Pitch Black Afro” made a dramatic entry into the courtroom on Tuesday when he made wild gestures and greeted people in attendance including his mother. The well-known Hip Hop artist allegedly murdered his wife Catherine Modisane at a bed and breakfast lodge in Yeoville on December 30. Dressed in a green shirt and a pair of blue jeans the accused smiled and appeared unconcerned that he was facing a serious charge of murder. The Matofotofo hitmaker has been behind bars for more than a week and was expected to apply for bail. Magistrate Lucas van der Schyff who presided over the matter at the Johannesburg Magistrate’s court warned journalists not to take photographs of the accused with their phones. Photographers were exempted from the instruction. The prosecutor told the court that more time was needed to verify the address of the accused. Van der Schyff postponed the matter for the second time to Friday. Ngcobo will remain in custody until his next appearance. (ANA)
