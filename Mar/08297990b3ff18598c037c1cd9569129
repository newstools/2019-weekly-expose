Islamabad – Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan has condemned the shootings at two mosques in New Zealand’s Christchurch, which killed at least 40 people. “Shocked and strongly condemn the Christchurch, New Zealand, terrorist attack on mosques. This reaffirms what we have always maintained: that terrorism does not have a religion,” Khan tweeted. “I blame these increasing terror attacks on the current Islamophobia post-9/11 where Islam & 1.3 bn Muslims have collectively been blamed for any act of terror by a Muslim,” he added. “This has been done deliberately to also demonize legitimate Muslim political struggles.”  (dpa)
